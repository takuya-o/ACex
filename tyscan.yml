    # The message to display when TyScan finds a code piece that matches the pattern.

    # a violation of the pattern can be ignored.
    justification: Allowed when debugging.

    # [Optional] You can check whether the pattern works as expected with `tyscan test`. See

    tests:
      # Code pieces that are expected to match the pattern.
      match:
        - consoleX.log('Log message');
        - consoleX.error('Error message');

      # Code pieces that are NOT expected to match the pattern.
      unmatch:
        - consoleX; # This does not match the pattern since no method is invoked.
